          <p class="fw-semibold text-center">A golf cart (alternatively known as
            a golf buggy or golf car[a]) is a small motorized vehicle designed
            originally to carry two golfers and their golf clubs around a golf
            course with less effort than walking. Over time, variants were
            introduced that were capable of carrying more passengers, had
            additional utility features, or were certified as a street legal
            low-speed vehicle.</p>
          <p class="fw-semibold text-center">A traditional golf cart, capable of
            carrying two golfers and their clubs, is generally around 4 feet
            (1.2 m) wide, 8 feet (2.4 m) long and 6 feet (1.8 m) high, weighing
            between 900 to 1,000 pounds (410 to 450 kg) and capable of speeds up
            to about 15 miles per hour (24 km/h).[b] The price of a golf cart
            can range anywhere from under US$1,000 to well over US$20,000 per
            cart, depending on how it is equipped.</p>
          <p class="fw-semibold text-center">Reportedly, the first use of a
            motorized cart on a golf course was by JK Wadley of Texarkana, who
            saw a three-wheeled electric cart being used in Los Angeles to
            transport senior citizens to a grocery store. Later, he purchased a
            cart and found that it worked poorly on a golf course.[2] The first
            electric golf cart was custom-made in 1932, but did not gain
            widespread acceptance.[3] In the 1930s until the 1950s the most
            widespread use of golf carts was for those with disabilities who
            could not walk far.[4] By the mid 1950s the golf cart had gained
            wide acceptance with US golfers.[5]</p>
